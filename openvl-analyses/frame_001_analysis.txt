Question: At 0.0 seconds: What is happening in this video, if there is a fight happening then mark it 'ALERT

Answer:
At 0.0 seconds, the video shows a person in the middle of a store aisle gesturing with their hands, while two other people are standing nearby. It doesn't appear to be a fight; it looks more like a conversation or an explanation. I would not mark it as an "ALERT."
